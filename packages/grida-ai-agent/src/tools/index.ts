/**
 * Capability-driven tool registry for the Grida agent.
 *
 * The fs and todos tools are always present in the registry — they're
 * the agent's baseline VFS + planning vocabulary. What changes per
 * callsite is *who resolves them*:
 *
 *   - **Client-resolved** (web SVG demo, standalone doc window).
 *     The package leaves fs/todos tools without `execute()`. The
 *     consumer (the React `@ai-sdk/react` Chat with `onToolCall`, or
 *     a chat-transcript reducer) calls `AgentFs.resolveToolCall`
 *     against its own `AgentFs` instance — typically one bound to a
 *     live editor.
 *
 *   - **Server-resolved** (workspace-bound agent host). The consumer
 *     injects `fs` and `todos` instances at agent-creation time; we
 *     wrap each fs/todos tool with an `execute()` that calls
 *     `AgentFs.resolveToolCall` / `AgentTodos.resolveToolCall` inline.
 *     The agent loop handles them in-process — the client just
 *     observes chunks.
 *
 * Command execution is always server-resolved (the client has no
 * process-spawn capability). The command tool ships with `execute()`
 * baked in pointing at the injected backend; without an injected
 * backend, command execution is not in the
 * registry at all (the LLM never learns the capability exists).
 *
 * What we do NOT expose: a flat `tools` constant. The static set was
 * fine when SVG-only and capability-free; once "who resolves" is
 * conditional, exporting a single static record would lie about the
 * shape. Callers go through `createToolset`.

/**
 * TOOL-DESIGN (gridaco/grida#921) — read before adding or widening a tool.
 * Full doctrine (the why, the five lenses, tool-vs-connector-vs-skill):
 * docs/wg/ai/agent/tool-design.md. This is the concrete checklist + the
 * worked instance (`generate_image` shipped as a 7-arg mirror of the HTTP
 * route — the most complex tool here — and was cut to a single `prompt`;
 * see `../gen`).
 *
 * Build tools FOR AGENTS, not as API mirrors. The shape is what an agent needs
 * to express intent — not the provider's full parameter surface.
 *
 *  1. Minimal by default. Fewest args that let the agent express the intent.
 *     Prefer ONE natural-language arg over many typed knobs (a `prompt` with
 *     "wide 16:9 …" in the prose beats `aspect_ratio` + `size` + `seed`).
 *  2. Host config is NOT an agent arg. Model, provider, credentials, locale,
 *     paths — inject at construction (see `image_model_id`, `secrets`), never
 *     expose them as tool inputs.
 *  3. Don't expose a knob the agent can't GROUND (e.g. ids it can't enumerate)
 *     or one that doesn't reliably WORK — verify against the real provider
 *     first; a no-op param is a lie the model will trust (the dropped
 *     `aspect_ratio` was silently ignored by seedream/OpenRouter).
 *  4. Honest results. The output says what the tool actually did; don't promise
 *     a capability the wire format can't deliver (a tool result can't carry an
 *     image to an openai-compatible model — `generate_image` is generate-only).
 *  5. Auto-resolve simple inputs. Let the agent pass the dumbest sufficient
 *     thing and resolve the rest in the host — `generate_image` references take
 *     a path / URL / data URL; the host reads + inlines. Don't make the agent
 *     pre-encode a blob.
 *  6. Clear, typed failures. A bad call returns a reason the agent can act on
 *     (`invalid_input` naming the offending input), never a throw that ends the
 *     run.
 *
 * When in doubt, cut the arg. A tool you can't retract (the model learns to
 * depend on it) is more expensive than one you grow later.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Build the toolset record fed to `ToolLoopAgent({ tools })`. The
 * baseline (fs + todos) is unconditional; whether they carry
 * `execute()` depends on which bindings the caller injects.
