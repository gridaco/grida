// In-package channel between the headless editor and an attached surface.
//
// This is the contract a second surface implementation (worker-side
// renderer, headless test harness, native host) would drive. It is
// deliberately not exported from the package — adding a method here is a
// considered seam change, not organic accretion. See README §Surface for
// what is and isn't on the public boundary.
//
// Direction convention in the JSDoc below:
//   - "editor → surface"  — the surface registers a callback the editor
//     invokes (driver / resolver / provider slots).
//   - "surface → editor"  — the surface calls into the editor to publish
//     a fact or open a history bracket.
