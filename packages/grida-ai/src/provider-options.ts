/**
 * Producer contract for the billing seam's `grida` provider-options key.
 *
 * The Vercel AI SDK's `providerOptions` slot is an OPEN `Record<string,
 * Record<string, JSONValue>>`, so a hand-written `{ grida: {...} }` literal
 * type-checks with ANY keys — which is exactly how a snake_cased
 * `organization_id` shipped past `tsc` and failed only at runtime, when the
 * billing middleware read `organizationId` (camelCase) and found `undefined`.
 *
 * This is the single, typed producer contract shared by EVERY billed call
 * site: the editor seam (`editor/lib/ai/server.ts`, which re-exports this and
 * derives its read-side type from it) AND the framework-free `@grida/agent`
 * package, which cannot import the seam. `organizationId` and `feature` — the
 * two fields the middleware requires — are MANDATORY, so a missing or
 * misspelled key is a compile error at the call site, not a runtime
 * `MissingOrgIdError`. Shared through `@grida/ai`; model facts do not own application attribution.
 *
 * NOTE: this types the org-id KEY; it does NOT verify the org id. Verification
 * (member-org check) is GRIDA-SEC-003's job and lives upstream in the editor's
 * `requireOrganizationId`. Strict in what we produce, lenient in what the seam
 * accepts (the middleware reads defensively).
