/**
 * GRIDA-SEC-004 — cross-instance "open" handoff codec.
 *
 * macOS hands a file opened via "Open With" to a *new* instance when our
 * app is not the **default** handler for that type (`.svg` is
 * `LSHandlerRank: Alternate`; `.grida` is `Owner`). That new instance
 * loses the single-instance lock and would otherwise quit and drop the
 * file. The fix is for the secondary to *forward* the open to the running
 * primary instead — riding `app.requestSingleInstanceLock(additionalData)`
 * → the primary's `second-instance` event (the only documented
 * secondary→primary channel). See the macOS limitation in
 * electron/electron#14029 and the wiring in `main.ts`.
 *
 * This module is the **wire contract** for that handoff: pure, no electron
 * imports, so the secondary's `encode` and the primary's `decode` are one
 * testable unit. The two ends are written by the same hand but cross a
 * process boundary — treat it like a protocol: `decode` is tolerant and
 * yields `[]` for any shape it doesn't recognize (a foreign or legacy
 * `second-instance` payload must never be mistaken for our opens).
 *
 * `fromArgv` + `isSupportedFile` live here too: classifying an argv entry
 * as a file/url open is the same pure "what counts as an open" logic, used
 * for the Windows/Linux path where files arrive on the command line rather
 * than via the macOS `open-file` Apple Event.
