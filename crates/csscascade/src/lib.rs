//! csscascade - A modern, Rust-native CSS Cascade & Style Resolution Engine
//!
//! This crate implements the CSS cascade and style resolution for building
//! browser-like rendering pipelines. It takes an HTML (and later SVG) DOM tree
//! and produces a style-resolved static tree ready for layout and painting.

// Public API will be added here as the crate is developed
