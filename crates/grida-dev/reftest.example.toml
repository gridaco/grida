# Example reftest.toml
# Copy this file into your test suite directory and adjust paths/settings.

# Use a directory-friendly name (e.g., "W3C_SVG_11_TestSuite").
# This may be used as the default output folder name under target/{name}/ in future versions.

# Paths are relative to this reftest.toml file

# e.g., all files under svg/ recursively
inputs = "svg/**/*.svg"

# Background to composite before diffing: "black" or "white"
# For text-heavy SVGs, "white" is often a better choice
