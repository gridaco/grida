# Example reftest.toml
# Copy this file into your test suite directory and adjust paths/settings.

# Use a directory-friendly name (e.g., "W3C_SVG_11_TestSuite").
# This may be used as the default output folder name under target/{name}/ in future versions.

[test]
name = "Example_SVG_Test_Suite"
# Required: currently only "svg" is supported
type = "svg"

# Paths are relative to this reftest.toml file
# inputs: ALWAYS USE A GLOB so nested files are picked up
# e.g., all files under svg/ recursively
inputs = "svg/**/*.svg"
# expects: directory that contains expected PNG files (same basenames/relative paths as SVGs)
expects = "png"

# Background to composite before diffing: "black" or "white"
# For text-heavy SVGs, "white" is often a better choice
bg = "white"

[test.diff]
# Anti-aliasing detection (when true, AA pixels are not counted as diffs)
aa = true
# Dify threshold in YIQ space (0.0 = strict, count any difference)
threshold = 0.0

[test.scoring]
# Masking mode for scoring: "none" (all pixels) or "alpha" (only non-transparent pixels)
# When "alpha", scoring considers only pixels where either expected or actual alpha > 0.
# This is useful for SVG tests with large transparent regions, as transparent pixels
# won't skew the mismatch ratio.
mask = "alpha"  # or "none"
