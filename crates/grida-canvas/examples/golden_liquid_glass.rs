// **Light**
// Adjust the angle and intensity of the light illuminating your glass frames to change where the highlight appears on the frameâ€™s edge.
// **Refraction**
// Control the way light bends along the edge of your glass frame. The higher the refraction value, the more your glass frames will distort the elements around them.
// **Depth**
// Change how thick your glass material appears to provide a more pronounced 3D feel to the edge of the frame.
// **Dispersion**
// Increase dispersion to add a hint of chromatic aberration at the edge of your glass frames. This works best in combination with refraction.
// **Frost**
// Adjust the amount of background blur present on your glass frames to help glass elements stand out on busy backgrounds to provide better contrast.
