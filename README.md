**Google Forms / Type form / ...**

Yes, this project indeed aims to replace Google Forms, Typeform, and other form builders. And we believe our tool is better option for building powerful and beautiful forms. You can have the same functionality and make it your own with lots of customization options.

**Notion**

No, this project does not aim to provide a document management system like Notion, although we are trying to keep the same simplicity and ease of use.

**Figma**

50/50. Our goal is to make a one platform for all creators, developers, designers, and business owners. It may take some time, but we are researching the right way and tech to provide a powerful design tool. You can learn more about this on or [Nothing Graphics Engine](https://github.com/gridaco/nothing) project (not active atm).

**Framer**

50/50. Where Framer is more of a tool for building interactive websites, we aim to build a data-first working prototype tool. We will be focusing on data query and state management part for this with various templates.

## Keeping Grida as 'Free' as possible

Since 2020, I’ve dedicated myself full-time to building Grida, often facing challenges to sustain both my work and the company (and that's why we have [grida.studio](https://grida.studio)). My vision is simple: the world deserves a powerful, free tool that helps people get things done. To support students, solo founders, contributors, and open-source projects, we’re offering the Pro tier of our hosted service at no cost. [Join our Slack channel](https://grida.co/join-slack) and reach me out. My handle is @universe.
