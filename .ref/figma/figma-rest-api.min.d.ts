 * rotation, and skew.
 *
 * The identity transform is [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]].
 *
 * A translation matrix will typically look like:
 *
 *     ;[
 *       [1, 0, tx],
 *       [0, 1, ty],
 *     ]
 *

 *
 *     ;[
 *       [cos(angle), sin(angle), 0],
 *       [-sin(angle), cos(angle), 0],
 *     ]
 *
 * Another way to think about this transform is as three vectors:
 *
 * - The x axis (t[0][0], t[1][0])
 * - The y axis (t[0][1], t[1][1])
 * - The translation offset (t[0][2], t[1][2])
 *
 * The most common usage of the Transform matrix is the `relativeTransform property`. This
 * particular usage of the matrix has a few additional restrictions. The translation offset can take
 * on any value but we do enforce that the axis vectors are unit vectors (i.e. have length 1). The
 * axes are not required to be at 90Â° angles to each other.
