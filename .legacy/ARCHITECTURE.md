# Opensource Design Tool for the world.

_For whom eager to create, design, develop and share with the world._

> **Grida (Previously known as _Bridged 2022_ - opensource collaborative realtime ui editor)**
>
> an opensource wasm application explicitly designed for service application design/development

- developer first
- plugin sdk and core engine api is mapped 1:1
- right on to production code

## `Alpha` - This project is under development and Unstable

This project, `Grida` is under development with preview technologies. We are looking forward that Grida will change the industry design/development standard by this piece of OSS Project. For updates, please subscribe our news letter on [grida.co](https://grida.co)

**Stable Ecosystem Projects**

- [Grida Assistant](https://github.com/gridaco/assistant) - A plugin fro figma that allows to import designs to Grida.
- [Grida Code](https://github.com/gridaco/code) - Design to Code Engine. A design ‚úåÔ∏è code standard.

## Engine & Foundation

- studio is built uppon skia graphics library
- the core component used is followed by _[reflect design system](https://refkect-ui,com)_
- studio's surface is built on react

## Docs

Read the Grida usage docs [here](../docs)

## Workspace

artboard workspace

## Scriptable

scripting built in with js/ts sdk and add-on plugin

## Backend

[Live Collaborative Design Server](https://github.com/gridaco/design-server)

## The design

design of Grida editor on [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/Y0Gh77AqBoHH7dG1GtK3xF/?node-id=0%3A1)

## Bridging the gap between design and development

Here are some concepts that do not exist on current design tools, but only at implementation.

- Theme support
- Responsive layout
- Linting
- Grid
- List
- Slots (Not swapping components)
- States
- Git
- Variables
- Data layer
- Logic layer
- Design to code
- Built in base design system (Reflect - a universal design system built for design systems)

## Key features / modes

- presentation mode
- muggle mode
- developer mode
- graphics mode
- designer mode
- product mode
- prototype mode
- documentation mode
- diagram mode (EDR)
- live collaborative editing
- version control in-the-box
- responsive mode (responsive components)
