### `uid`

`uid` is the system generated `uuidv4` unique identifier of the customer. this cannot be modified or provided by the user.

### `uuid`

`uuid` is a `uuidv4` format unique identifier of the customer. this can be provided by the user.
this is useful when the customer is created in another system and you want to keep the sync between the two systems.

Use this to ensure "uniqueness" of the customer within the CRM and related features.

For example,

- customer from your database
- customer from salesforce

### `phone`

`phone` is a phone number of the customer in E.164 format. If you don't know how to format the phone number properly, you can use the
[Grida E.164 tool](https://app.grida.co/tools/e164) to format the phone number.

### `tags`

A list of tags associated with the customer. Tags are managed per project, can have descriptions, and are useful for categorization, segmentation, and quick filtering.

Tags are created automatically if they don't already exist when provided during customer creation or update operations.

Example:

```json
{
  "tags": ["premium", "vip", "new-customer"]
}
```

- Tags are project-scoped and uniquely identified by their name.
- Renaming a tag automatically updates all customer-tag associations.
- Deleting a tag removes all customer-tag associations. (does not delete the customer)

> **CSV Note:** When providing the `tags` within the CSV file, you should provide comma separated text (for example, `"tag1,tag2,tag3"`). The list of tags must be wrapped in quotation marks.

Learn more about [tags](/platform/tags/index.md).

### `metadata`

Set of key-value pairs that you can attach to a customer. This can be
useful for storing additional information about the object in a
structured format.

> **CSV Note:** When providing the `meatadata.*` within the CSV file, you should provide the flat JSON object.

For example, you want to upload

```json
{
  "my_custom_field_1": "value 1",
  "my_custom_field_2": "value 2"
}
```

You should provide the following value in the CSV file.

```csv
metadata.my_custom_field_1,metadata.my_custom_field_2
value 1,value 2
```

> **IMPORTANT**: We do not support partial update of `metadata`. in all operations, you must provide the full metadata with the previous values included.

## Working with CSV

You can use the CSV file to bulk insert or update data into the Grida customer object.

> We don't support upsert with csv file. you'll need to use api for upsertion.
