# Working Group

Welcome to the Grida Working Group documentation!

This section contains technical documents that guide the development and architecture of Grida. Here you'll find working group documents, architectural design notes, implementation plans, and ongoing tasks.

## What's Here

The working group documentation serves as the technical knowledge base for contributors and maintainers. These documents cover:

- **Architecture Documents** - Design decisions, system architecture, and technical specifications
- **Working Notes** - In-progress research, proposals, and discussion documents
- **Implementation Plans** - Detailed plans for upcoming features and improvements
- **Technical Tasks** - Tracked work items and development priorities

## Who This Is For

These documents are primarily for:

- Core contributors working on Grida's implementation
- Developers looking to understand the technical design and decisions
- Anyone interested in contributing to Grida's architecture and development

## Contributing

Working group documents are living documents that evolve with the project. If you're contributing to Grida and need to document architectural decisions or technical plans, this is the right place.
