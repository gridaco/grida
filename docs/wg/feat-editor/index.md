title: Editor Features (WG)
---

Editor features are a collection of **Grida editor-specific** behaviors and capabilities. These documents focus on **practical implementation details** over mathematical abstractions, emphasizing real-world UX and editor workflows.

## Scope

- **In scope**: Editor-specific features, Grida-specific behaviors, practical UX specifications
- **Focus**: Practical implementation > mathematical/theoretical models
- **Out of scope**: Generic algorithms, pure mathematical models, backend-agnostic features

## Documents

- [**UX Surface**](./ux-surface/) - Grida editor's specific practical UX specifications

## Characteristics

These documents prioritize:

- **Practical over mathematical**: Real-world implementation details take precedence over theoretical models
- **Editor-specific**: Features unique to the Grida editor experience
- **UX-focused**: User experience and interaction patterns are central
