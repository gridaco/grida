# Unicode Coverage Tracker (UCT)

## Overview

The **Unicode Coverage Tracker (UCT)** is a proposed core engine feature designed to monitor and report the extent of Unicode character coverage within a given text processing context. By tracking which Unicode characters are supported and which are missing, UCT aims to improve internationalization support, font fallback strategies, and overall text rendering quality.

This document serves as a working group draft to outline the motivation, design, usage, and future directions for the UCT feature.

## Motivation

Modern applications require robust support for the full range of Unicode characters to deliver seamless multilingual experiences. However, many engines and rendering pipelines lack comprehensive mechanisms to track which Unicode characters are actually supported or rendered correctly.

The UCT feature addresses this gap by providing a systematic way to:

- Identify unsupported or partially supported Unicode characters.
- Inform fallback mechanisms to select appropriate fonts or rendering strategies.
- Collect coverage data to guide font development and engine improvements.

## Design

The Unicode Coverage Tracker integrates into the core engine's text processing pipeline. Its key components include:

- **Character Coverage Database:** Maintains a record of Unicode characters and their support status.
- **Tracking Mechanism:** Monitors text input and updates coverage data in real-time.
- **Reporting Interface:** Provides APIs for querying coverage statistics and unsupported characters.
- **Integration Hooks:** Allows other engine components, such as font selection and shaping modules, to leverage coverage information.

The design emphasizes extensibility and efficiency, ensuring minimal performance impact while enabling detailed coverage insights.

## Usage

Developers and applications can utilize UCT to:

- Query which Unicode characters are supported in the current context.
- Receive notifications or logs about unsupported characters during text rendering.
- Adjust font fallback and shaping strategies based on coverage data.
- Generate reports summarizing Unicode coverage for diagnostics or analytics.

Example usage scenarios include multilingual document editors, web browsers, and text rendering engines aiming for comprehensive Unicode support.

## Relationship to ICU/Blink

While ICU provides extensive Unicode and internationalization utilities, UCT focuses specifically on real-time coverage tracking within the core rendering engine. UCT complements ICU by supplying coverage data that can inform ICU's locale and script handling.

Similarly, Blink's text rendering pipeline benefits from UCT by gaining precise coverage information to optimize font fallback and shaping. UCT acts as a bridge between Unicode data libraries and rendering components.

## Future Work

Planned enhancements for UCT include:

- Expanding coverage granularity to include script and block-level statistics.
- Integrating machine learning models to predict missing coverage and suggest fonts.
- Developing visualization tools for Unicode coverage analysis.
- Collaborating with font developers to automate coverage improvements based on UCT data.

Feedback and contributions from the working group and community are encouraged to refine and evolve the Unicode Coverage Tracker.
