# Text node auto size

Double-click a text node's edge to reset its dimensions to `auto`.

- Double-click the left or right edge to set the width to `auto`.
- Double-click the top or bottom edge to set the height to `auto`.
- Alignment is preserved: when the text is right, center, or bottom
  aligned, the node's position shifts so the alignment point stays fixed
  after auto sizing.
