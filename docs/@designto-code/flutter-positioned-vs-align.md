# Flutter - positioning - when to use `Positioned` vs `Align`

**Bullet points**

- `Positioned` can only be used within a `Stack` and positions a child relative to the Stack size. ([ref](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55100667/5463235))
- `Positioned` is an offset based alignment which uses DP as unit ([ref](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55100710/5463235))
- `Align` use a % of the parent size ([ref](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55100710/5463235))
