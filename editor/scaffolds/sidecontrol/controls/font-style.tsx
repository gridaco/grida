/**
 * Font Style (Variation Instance) Control Component
 *
 * This component is a font-pre-defined style picker designed specifically for usage with:
 * - OpenType STAT Axis names
 * - fvar.instances
 *
 * While this may look similar to font-weight.tsx, this component is explicitly designed
 * for handling font style variations through OpenType font features rather than generic
 * font weight controls.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This component requires a proper font parser to function correctly.
 * The component itself does not provide font parsing functionality - it is purely
 * a UI wrapper around font parsing results. You must integrate this with a font
 * parser that can extract STAT axis information and fvar instances from OpenType fonts.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Pass parsed font style data (STAT axis values, fvar instances) as props
 * - Handle style selection changes through the provided callbacks
 * - Ensure your font parser provides the necessary data structure this component expects
