/**
 * `useTurnQueueController` — the single owner of host-side queued-sends
 * wiring (RFC [Turn Queue](../../../docs/wg/ai/agent/queue.md)).
 *
 * Both desktop chat surfaces (the standalone-doc `ai-sidebar/chat.tsx` and the
 * workspace `workbench/agent-pane.tsx`) drive the queue through this one hook.
 * It composes the optimistic mirror ({@link useQueuedMessages}) with the pure
 * submit decision ({@link decideSubmit}) and turns it into the one side effect
 * the surface owns: `send` (start a turn now). A submit while the session is
 * busy enqueues instead.
 *
 * The DRAIN is NOT here. Firing the next queued turn is CORE state now (the
 * `SessionScheduler` fires it on a clean idle edge); the surface only reacts to
 * the resulting `SessionStatus` (see `use-session-status.ts`). This hook keeps
 * no drain authority — it just gates submit-vs-enqueue and mirrors the queue.
